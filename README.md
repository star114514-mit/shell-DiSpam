日本語での説明は[こちら](https://github.com/star114514-mit/shell-DiSpam/blob/main/README_jp.md)
# shell-DiSpam
This tool can be used to send spam on Discord from Linux.
Dependencies are `xdotool` and `xclip`.
_There is no support for Windows. _
# How to use
Open the Discord channel you want to spam and run the shell script of your choice, and then spamming will start.
# Difference between shell scripts
While `nnsp.sh` allows you to specify in advance what kind of spam you want to send, `nhsp.sh` gets sentences from the rant api, so the spam content is random.
